38,24,"Food- Good, Service - Terrible",2024-04-19 21:36:17.479463,1,"Quality of the food, when it is freshly prepared, is good but if you keep the food for sometime like 1 Hr., it will smell very bad.
I think the oils and the spices they are using are of cheap quality, but they are charging the customers more than the standard charges. Also, the behaviour of the owner of the shop is very rude. He never talks in polite way to the customers.
For regular food, I will never suggest pizza express but within a month, you can give it a try."
